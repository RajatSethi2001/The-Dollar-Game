Title: The Dollar Game - 3 Difficulties

Description: There are circles with (or without money). Some circles have a surplus while others are in debt.
The goal is to make sure that all the circles are out of debt. Circles have two moves, a lending move or a 
borrowing move. They can either lend out $1 to ALL connecting circles or borrow $1 from ALL connecting circles.
